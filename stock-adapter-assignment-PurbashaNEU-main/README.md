### Overview
Implement an Adapter design pattern for Stock Program. 
Created a Client API and a Legacy API, ensuring that both APIs are distinct. 
The Adapter, designed to bridge the gap between the Client API and the Legacy API, derives from the Client API using class composition through inheritance (IS-A relationship).
Moreover, the Adapter utilizes the Legacy API by employing object composition (HAS-A relationship), allowing seamless integration of the existing Legacy object within the new Client API. 
The implementation should includes a static demo method within the Adapter to showcase the functionality of the Adapter design pattern.
